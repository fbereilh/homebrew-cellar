# Homebrew formula for Cellar.
#
# Cellar tracks LATEST (git main), not tagged semver releases, so this is a
# HEAD-only formula: `brew install --HEAD cellar` builds from the current tip of
# fbereilh/cellar, and `cellar --update` runs `brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD cellar`
# to move to the newest main.
#
# The canonical copy of this file lives in the app repo at
# packaging/homebrew/cellar.rb; the installable copy lives in the tap repo
# fbereilh/homebrew-cellar at Formula/cellar.rb. Keep the two in sync.
#
# NOTE: fbereilh/cellar is a PRIVATE repo, so `brew install` needs the invoking
# user's GitHub git credentials (gh auth / SSH / a PAT) to clone main.
